# FrescoGUI

Welcome! This is a GUI to use with an axidraw to draw Fresco json files.

# Running

In the near future I'll add a user friendly launcher. But for now, start a python server with
`python3 -m http.server`

Then navigate to whatever sketch you want to draw. When all is fine, press `a`.
A new tab should open with your drawing previewed on the left. Firefox and Chrome may block the new tab
so make sure to allow it.

If you want to use the GUI with a pre-existing file, simply lauch the `axidraw.html` file right after
opening the server and load your file in the option pannel.
